Quantum machine learning (QML)
Quantum machine learning (QML) represents a groundbreaking fusion of quantum computing and classical machine learning techniques, promising to revolutionize various fields, from cryptography to optimization and artificial intelligence. Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that classical computers struggle with. QML models harness these quantum phenomena to enhance classical machine learning algorithms. Key QML algorithms include quantum support vector machines, quantum neural networks, and quantum annealers. These models address complex optimization problems, classification tasks, and unsupervised learning, respectively. They exhibit remarkable capabilities, such as faster solutions to certain optimization tasks and potential advantages in learning complex data patterns.
